<h3>ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Gail!</h3>
<p>I'm a software engineer with a passion for creative problem-solving and enhancing the user experience. After working as an Account Manager for an electronic medical record company, I discovered that it was the technical side of what I was doing that really fascinated me.</p>

<p>&#x1F4BB In 2021, I completed a 12-week software engineering immersive boot camp at General Assembly, where I honed my front-end development skills and gained experience in back-end development. My friends often comment on my creativity and ask why I didn't pursue a career in design, but I love being able to bring ideas to life through coding. I'm proficient in <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, SASS, React</strong>, and a variety of tech stacks, and I enjoy collaborating with others on GitHub.</p>

<p>When I'm not coding, you can find me rock climbing &#x1F9D7 &#x200D, hiking &#x1F97E, researching brain/bio-hacking &#x1F9E0, and baking bread &#x1F956. I'm always looking for new ways to challenge myself and stay inspired!</p>

<p>My professional goals are centered around my passion for enhancing people's lives and making the world a better place. I'm looking for a workplace that aligns with these values and provides opportunities for mentorship, learning, and growth. I believe in fostering an innovative and communicative environment where employees are recognized as people and can thrive. As a go-to person for answers, I aim to contribute to strategic planning and to work smarter, not harder, in order to make people's lives easier. I'm excited to connect with like-minded individuals and companies who share my vision.</p>
